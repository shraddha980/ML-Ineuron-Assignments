    "Machine learning (ML) inference is the process of running live data points into a machine learning algorithm (or “ML model”) to calculate an output such as a single numerical score. This process is also referred to as “operationalizing an ML model” or “putting an ML model into production.” When an ML model is running in production, it is often then described as artificial intelligence (AI) since it is performing functions similar to human thinking and analysis. Machine learning inference basically entails deploying a software application into a production environment, as the ML model is typically just software code that implements a mathematical algorithm. That algorithm makes calculations based on the characteristics of the data, known as “features” in the ML vernacular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning uses two types of techniques: supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, and unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning Supervised machine learning builds a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output) and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data. Use supervised learning if you have known data for the output you are trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning uses classification and regression techniques to develop machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification techniques predict discrete responses—for example, whether an email is genuine or spam, or whether a tumor is cancerous or benign. Classification models classify input data into categories. Typical applications include medical imaging, speech recognition, and credit scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use classification if your data can be tagged, categorized, or separated into specific groups or classes. For example, applications for hand-writing recognition use classification to recognize letters and numbers. In image processing and computer vision, unsupervised pattern recognition techniques are used for object detection and image segmentation. The most common algorithms for performing classification can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression techniques predict continuous responses—for example, hard-to-measure physical quantities such as battery state-of-charge, electricity load on the grid, or prices of financial assets. Typical applications include virtual sensing, electricity load forecasting, and algorithmic trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use regression techniques if you are working with a data range or if the nature of your response is a real number, such as temperature or the time until failure for a piece of equipment. The most common algorithms for performing regression can be found here.\n",

    "Market Basket Analysis is modelled on Association rule mining, i.e., the IF {}, THEN {} construct. For example, IF a customer buys bread, THEN he is likely to buy butter as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association rules are usually represented as: {Bread} -> {Butter}\n",
    "\n",
    "Some terminologies to familiarize yourself with Market Basket Analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Antecedent:Items or 'itemsets' found within the data are antecedents. In simpler words, it's the IF component, written on the left-hand side. In the above example, bread is the antecedent.\n",
    "Consequent:A consequent is an item or set of items found in combination with the antecedent. It's the THEN component, written on the right-hand side. In the above example, butter is the consequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm has been in our minds since 1994 and it helps us find frequent item sets in a dataset for boolean association rules. Name of the algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent item set properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, as mentioned above, the dataset must include products that are frequently bought. The data we need to apply this algorithm includes the following columns:\n",

    "Transaction ID (Basket ID)\n",
    "Product SKU (Product ID)\n",
    "Product Category\n",
    "Quantity\n",

    "\n",
    "This algorithm can be written and applied by R Studio, Python etc.\n",

    "imple Linear Regression\n",
    "Simple linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables. One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable. It looks for statistical relationship but not deterministic relationship. Relationship between two variables is said to be deterministic if one variable can be accurately expressed by the other. For example, using temperature in degree Celsius it is possible to accurately predict Fahrenheit. Statistical relationship is not accurate in determining relationship between two variables. For example, relationship between height and weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to obtain a line that best fits the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line."
