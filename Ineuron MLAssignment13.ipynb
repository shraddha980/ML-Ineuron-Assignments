    "In sentiment analysis, Naive Bayes is utilized to classify text sentiment. The approach assumes features (words) are independent given the sentiment.

    "As technology expands, machine learning provides an exciting opportunity in health care to improve the accuracy of diagnoses, personalize health care, and find novel solutions to decades-old problems. You can use machine learning to program computers to make connections and predictions, and discover critical insights from large amounts of data that health care providers may otherwise miss — all of this can add up to a direct impact on the health of your community.\n",

It provides a way to validate doctors’ reasoning and decisions through predictive algorithms. For example, suppose a doctor prescribes a specific medication for a patient. In that case, machine learning can validate this treatment plan by finding a patient with a similar medical history who benefitted from the same treatment."
