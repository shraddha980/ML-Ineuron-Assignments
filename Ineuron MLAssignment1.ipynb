    "Machine learning (ML) inference is the process of running live data points into a machine learning algorithm (or “ML model”) to calculate an output such as a single numerical score. This process is also referred to as “operationalizing an ML model” or “putting an ML model into production.” When an ML model is running in production, it is often then described as artificial intelligence (AI) since it is performing functions similar to human thinking and analysis. Machine learning inference basically entails deploying a software application into a production environment, as the ML model is typically just software code that implements a mathematical algorithm. That algorithm makes calculations based on the characteristics of the data, known as “features” in the ML vernacular."

    "1. Inadequate Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The backbone of any ML algorithm is the data it is trained on. The challenge arises when there is a shortage of both quality and quantity in the training dataset. Noisy, incorrect, or unclean data can significantly impact the effectiveness of ML algorithms. Addressing issues such as noisy data, inaccuracies, and difficulties in generalizing output data becomes paramount for accurate predictions.\n",

    "2. Poor Quality of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality is a recurring issue, with noisy, incomplete, and inaccurate data undermining the accuracy of classification and overall results. Achieving high-quality data is essential for the success of ML models, necessitating a meticulous approach to data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Non-representative Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The representativeness of training data directly influences the generalization capability of ML models. If training data fails to cover all relevant cases, the model may produce less accurate predictions, leading to bias against specific classes or groups. Using representative data in training mitigates biases and enhances prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model captures noise and inaccuracies from a large dataset, adversely affecting its performance. This can be mitigated by employing linear and parametric algorithms, increasing training data, or reducing model complexity. Conversely, underfitting arises from a model being too simple for the data, resulting in incomplete and inaccurate predictions. Methods to address underfitting include increasing model complexity, using better features, and adjusting constraints."

    "Insufficient Quantity of Training Data:\n",
    "Machine Learning is not quite there yet; it takes a lot of data for most Machine Learning algorithms to work properly. Even for very simple problems you typically need thousands of examples, and for complex problems such as image or speech recognition you may need millions of examples (unless you can reuse parts of an existing model). \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonrepresentative Training Data:\n",
    "The training data should be representative of the new cases to generalize well i.e., the data we use for training should cover all the cases that occurred and that is going to occur. By using a non-representative training set, the trained model is not likely to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor-Quality Data:\n",
    "In reality, we don’t directly start training the model, analyzing data is the most important step. But the data we collected might not be ready for training, some samples are abnormal from others having outliers or missing values for instance.\n",
    "In these cases, we can remove the outliers, or fill the missing features/values using median or mean (to fill height) or simply remove the attributes/instances with missing values, or train the model with and without these instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting the Training Data:\n",
    "Say you visited a restaurant in a new city. You looked at the menu to order something and found that the cost or bill is too high. You might be tempted to say that ‘all the restaurants in the city are too costly and not affordable’. Overgeneralizing is something that we do very frequently, and shockingly, the frameworks can likewise fall into a similar snare and in AI, we call it overfitting.\n",
    "At the point when the model is excessively unpredictable when compared to the noisiness of the training dataset, overfitting occurs. We can avoid it by:\n",
    "Gathering more training data.\n",
    "Selecting a model with fewer features, a higher degree polynomial model is not preferred compared to the linear model.\n",
    "Fix data errors, remove the outliers, and reduce the number of instances in the training set.\n",

    "Underfitting the Training Data:\n",
    "Underfitting which is opposite to overfitting generally occurs when the model is too simple to understand the base structure of the data. It’s like trying to fit into undersized pants. It generally happens when we have less information to construct an exact model and when we attempt to build or develop a linear model with non-linear information.\n",
