    "In machine learning, a feature is data that's used as the input for ML models to make predictions. Raw data is rarely in a format that is consumable by an ML model, so it needs to be transformed into features. This process is called feature engineering.Examples of numerical features include age, height, weight, and income. Numerical features can be used in machine learning algorithms directly. Categorical features are discrete values that can be grouped into categories. Examples of categorical features include gender, color, and zip code."

    "One general definition for relevance is that a feature can be regarded as irrelevant if it is conditionally independent of the class labels or it does not influence the class labels; in these cases, it can be discarded.In the table above, each feature contains either quantitative or qualitative information. Quantitative data is numerical. For example, the amount of rainfall or the temperature.  Qualitative data is discrete, with a finite number of well-known values, like weather_description in the above table.Sometimes you transform quantitative data into qualitative data so that it is easier for machine learning to find patterns in the data. For example, you might decide that the rainfall and temperature feature values are sparse and you donâ€™t have enough training data, so you transform them into categorical variables. For example, your training examples may have different values for the temperature and rainfall, and it becomes more difficult for your model to learn patterns in your data. However, if you transform rainfall into categories - [dry, damp, wet, torrential], your model can more easily learn to predict whether the amount of rainfall will be in one of those categories"
